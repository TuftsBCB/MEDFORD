# List of Major Tags

Brief description of all of the defined tags in MEDFORD. Click each tag to view the in-depth description of the tag purpose and what sub-tags are available.

Every tag in MEDFORD has the \<tag\>-Note sub tag unless specified otherwise, which can be used for other information about the tag that the author may find relevant, but not within the scope of the other sub-tags.

* [Contributor](#Contributor): Tag to describe any individual or funding source that is involved in the project.
* [Data](#Data): Tag to describe data sets in the project, such as RNA-Seq data. Can be either referenced (a link to a data set generated by someone else) or recorded (new data from this project.)
* [Date](#Date): A tag to store some sort of date, such as paper submission or acceptance.
* [Expedition](#Expedition): A tag to describe the trip in which data was collected, such as a cruise for coral data.
* [Journal](#Journal): Describes the journal in which this project is published, if applicable.
* [Keyword](#Keyword): Contains a keyword that can be used to search for this MEDFORD file that is considered relevant to the research within.
* [Method](#Method): Describes methods used in this research, such as DNA extraction kits.
* [Paper](#Paper): Accession information for the published location of this research, if applicable.
* [Project](#Project): Brief description of the research stored within this MEDFORD file.
* [Software](#Software): Software used in the research described by this MEDFORD file, such as rna-seq software.
* [Species](#Species): Species involved in the research, including locality information if applicable.

# In-Depth Tag Examples

## Contributor

A contributor tag is used to describe either an individual involved in the research described by this MEDFORD file, or a funding source. A contributor is not necessarily an author but may be some other collaborator, such as an individual who performed the sample collection.

If a contributor tag is being used to describe an individual, the sub-tags are as follows:
1. Contributor: The name of the contributor.
2. Contributor-ORCID: ...
3. Contributor-Association: ...
4. Contributor-Role: ...
5. Contributor-Email: ...
6. Contributor-Type: Individual

If a contributor tag is being used to describe a source of funding, the sub-tags are as follows:
1. Contributor: The name of the funding source.
2. Contributor-Type: Funding
3. Contributor-???: **TODO** Additional tag for funding #?

## Data

A tag describing a data set involved in the research within the MEDFORD file. All data, be it new or a reference to existing data, should have its own data tag, as the purpose is for future readers to be able to know exactly which dataset and what version of the dataset was used.

The sub-tags are as follows:
1. **Data**: A description of the data.
2. **Data-Type**: A string describing the way the data is stored in relation to this MEDFORD file. 'Website', 'Database', 'Github' are some examples.
3. **Data-URI**: If applicable, the URL to the data. This could be a github repository link or a database link.
4. **Data-Flag**: 'recorded' or 'referenced'; a description of whether the data is new to the research within this MEDFORD file ('recorded') or taken from another source ('referenced'). This is set to 'referenced' by default.

### Examples
An example of how RNA-seq data generated for the research within a MEDFORD document would be:
```
@Data P.damicornis RNA-seq
@Data-Type ???
@Data-Flag recorded
```

An example of data stored within a database would be:
```
@Data NCBI Pocillopora damicornis genome
@Data-Type Database
@Data-URI https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=Pocillopora+damicornis
```

## Date

A tag describing dates of interest for the research within the MEDFORD file. Common examples include: date submitted for publishing, date accepted for publishing, and date published. Dates should be written in the following format:

1. Date YYYY-MM-DD
2. Date-Note ...

For example, the date this was example was written would be documented as follows:

```
@Date 2021-03-02
@Date-Note Published
```
